# Mock Portfolio Exercise

# What I have learned building this

> Switching styles among multiple stylesheets by means of JS  
> HTML dataset and ways to use them efficiently  
> Add downloadable resources in my website  
> Refresher on LocalStorage (get/set) items. The website records your choice and saves it within it  
> General tidy up rules for my css files (variables, font sizes...)  
> Grid Template areas. Minmax. Autofit, Autofill.   
> ## The most important thing I have learnt was the story of the teacher, and how he managed to set up a business building a website, and exploiting the power of SEOs to create a sought after company.
